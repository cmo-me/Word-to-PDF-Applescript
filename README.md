Word-to-PDF-Applescript - Deprecated
====================================

I am no longer using this script. Please test thoroughly and update as needed if you choose to use this.

WATCH-OUT - there is a bug in the script that saves pdf's of already open documents instead of the intended word document. DO NOT USE ON PUBLIC FOLDERS WHERE UNINTENDED INFORMATION COULD BE SHARED'

For the time being, use only when Word is closed or has no other documents open. I have not investigated this bug yet

An applescript that opens a file in word and saves it to PDF. Intended to be activated via Hazel

Described how I use this file at [scrubbs.me post](http://www.scrubbs.me/my-notes-blog/2014/3/1/automatically-convert-word-documents-to-pdf)
